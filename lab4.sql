-- ==========================================
-- Part 1: Basic SELECT Queries
-- ==========================================

-- Task 1.1: Select all employees, displaying their full name, department, and salary[cite: 3]
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name, department, salary
FROM employees;

-- Task 1.2: Use SELECT DISTINCT to find all unique departments in the company[cite: 3]
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees;

-- Task 1.3: Select all projects with names, budgets, and budget category using CASE[cite: 3]
SELECT project_name, budget,
       CASE
           WHEN budget > 150000 THEN 'Large'
           WHEN budget BETWEEN 100000 AND 150000 THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'Small'
       END AS budget_category
FROM projects;

-- Task 1.4: Use COALESCE to display employee names and emails (handle NULLs)[cite: 3]
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
       COALESCE(email, 'No email provided') AS email
FROM employees;


-- Part 2: WHERE Clause and Comparison Operators


-- Task 2.1: Find all employees hired after January 1, 2020[cite: 3, 4]

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary BETWEEN 60000 AND 70000;

-- Task 2.3: Find all employees whose last name starts with 'S' or 'J'[cite: 4]
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE 'S%'
   OR last_name LIKE 'J%';

-- Task 2.4: Find all employees who have a manager and work in the IT department[cite: 4]
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE manager_id IS NOT NULL
  AND department = 'IT';


-- Part 3: String and Mathematical Functions


-- Task 3.1: Display uppercase names, last name lengths, and first 3 characters of email[cite: 4]
SELECT UPPER(CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)) AS employee_name,
       LENGTH(last_name) AS last_name_length,
       SUBSTRING(email FROM 1 FOR 3) AS first_3_email_characters
FROM employees;

-- Task 3.2: Calculate annual salary, monthly salary (rounded), and 10% raise amount[cite: 4]
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS employee_name,
       salary AS annual_salary,
       ROUND(salary / 12, 2) AS monthly_salary,
       salary * 0.10 AS raise_amount
FROM employees;

-- Task 3.3: Use format() to create a formatted string for each project[cite: 4]
SELECT FORMAT(
            'Project: %s - Budget: $%s - Status: %s',
            project_name, budget, status
       ) AS project_info
FROM projects;

-- Task 3.4: Calculate years each employee has been with the company[cite: 4]
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS employee_name,
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(CURRENT_DATE, hire_date)) AS years_with_company
FROM employees;



-- Part 4: Aggregate Functions and GROUP BY

-- Task 4.1: Calculate the average salary for each department[cite: 4]
SELECT department, ROUND(AVG(salary), 2) AS average_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

-- Task 4.2: Find total hours worked on each project, including project name[cite: 4]
SELECT p.project_name,
       COALESCE(SUM(a.hours_worked), 0) AS total_hours
FROM projects p
LEFT JOIN assignments a ON p.project_id = a.project_id
GROUP BY p.project_id, p.project_name;

-- Task 4.3: Count employees per department, showing only those with > 1 employee[cite: 4]
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Task 4.4: Find max, min salary, and total payroll[cite: 4, 5]
